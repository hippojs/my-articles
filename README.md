# My Articles

A collection of articles. Ref:

- [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
- The folder `/sample-hangzhou-house-nowledge` for a sample structure (you will see broken images because for save storage, I deleted most of them)

## How to use it

1. Create a new folder for each new article, put image under it's subfolder `/images`.
2. Use kebab-case for file names and directory names. e.g. my-folder, my-awesome-new-article.
3. Name image with increase number, begin from 0 (yep, programmer always count start from 0 instead of 1, you knew that). If need to add new image, instead of renaming all the existing ones below it, put sub version. e.g. image-1, image-2, image-3, image-4. When wants to insert new image between image-3 and image-4, name it image-3.1.
